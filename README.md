Okay where do I even start

*************************************
Problem Statement :: Search for powers of 2
Return:
Any power of 2 number within 
the range of [0 .. 2^N - 1]


**************************************
Input :: number of qubits (type Int)

As I was running python here is an example:

from SimpleGrover import SearchForMarkedInput
print(SearchForMarkedInput(nQubits=6))

*************************************

Output :: Result (bit string) 
An arbiraty state that satisfies the problem statement
Also DumpMachine() is there to visually show that
all powers of two have increased probability while
everything else has almost 0.
